### FoodFresh is a prototype product developed during our 10 week summer internship at ADI that goes in a fridge and uses an array of gas sensors and machine learning to detect the state of food, classifying it into good and bad for consumption. This repository houses the source code for the data analysis, along with the 3D CAD models, and the presentation we used to create this prototype.

### The hardware parts required for this project along with the cost, and the link to purchase them can be found in the ADIproject/Final_Presentation                                                                                                                          
### Required Parts for Product can be split into three categories, the perfboard, and the two PCB's: 
Perfboard:                               
1x Arduino Nano |
1x MQ-135 |
1x MQ-3 |
1x SCD-40 |
1x TGS-2611 
1x LCD |

Version 1:                               
1x Arduino Nano |

## Software
### Originally started with Arduino, went to raspberry Pi to collect data. Went to Python for data analysis and then used Arduino ide to flash the arduino
### Little bit about PCA and clustering

## Assembly
### There are four different assemblies created for this product based on the stage of development. There is an enclosure for the Perfboard design that includes space for 4 AA batteries, an enclosure for PCB1 with 4 AA batteries, an enclosure for PCB2 with 2 AAA batteries, and a final enclosure for PCB2 with no batteries, and power being drawn from the fridge. The outer shell/case and the other components of the FoodFresh enclosure is meant to be 3D printed and assembled. The pieces slot in very well, however it is important that the 3D printer used is of high quality. and the infill density is relatively high for the Lids due to the number of small details present. The 3D models and SolidWorks files and assemblies for the case can be found under
